Dear Mansavi 🌸  
<br><br>
I didn’t want to send you something loud or dramatic today 💭  
Just something honest… and gentle 🤍
<br><br>
These roses 🌹 aren’t a promise or a question —  
they’re simply a reminder ✨  
A reminder that what we shared was real, meaningful,  
and beautiful in its own quiet way 🌷
<br><br>
I know things haven’t been easy lately 🌧️  
and I truly respect where you are right now 🕊️  
There’s no expectation, no pressure,  
no “you have to feel this too” 💫
<br><br>
I just wanted you to know that I still think of you warmly 💖  
with gratitude 🙏, care 🤍,  
and a calm kind of love that doesn’t rush 🌙
<br><br>
Whatever today means to you 🌼  
I hope it brings a small smile 😊  
You deserve that — always 🌟
<br><br>
— Preet 🌹🤍

Would you like to accept these roses 🌹 —  
just as a small, kind moment today? 🤍
</p>

            <button id="yes-btn">I’d like that 🌷</button>
            <button id="no-btn">Maybe another time 🌙</button>

        </div>
        
        <div class="success-message">
            <p>
Thank you for being here today 🤍  
Whatever tomorrow looks like 🌅,  
I’m grateful for what we once shared 🌸
